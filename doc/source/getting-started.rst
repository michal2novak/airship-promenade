Getting Started
===============

Note: This document is meant to give a general understanding of how Promenade
could be exercised in a development environment or for general learning and
understanding. For holistic Airship deployment procedures, refer to `Treasuremap <https://github.com/openstack/airship-treasuremap>`_

Basic Deployment
----------------

This approach is quick to get started, but generates the scripts used for
joining up-front rather than generating them in the API as needed.

Setup Build Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the machine you wish to use to generate deployment files, install docker:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt -y install docker.io

This can be the same machine you intend to be the Genesis host, or it may be
a separate build machine.

Generate Build files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create the certificates and scripts needed to perform a basic deployment,
you can use the following helper script on your build machine:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ./tools/simple-deployment.sh examples/basic build

This will copy the configuration provided in the ``examples/basic`` directory
into the ``build`` directory.  Then, it will generate self-signed certificates
for all the needed components in Deckhand-compatible format.  Finally, it will
render the provided configuration into directly-usable ``genesis.sh`` and
``join-<NODE>.sh`` scripts.

Genesis Host Provision
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install Ubuntu 16.04 on the machine intended to be the genesis host. Ensure
the host has outbound internet access and DNS resolution.
Ensure that the hostname matches the hostname specified in the Genesis.yaml
file used to build the above configurations.

Execution
^^^^^^^^^

Perform the following steps to execute the deployment:

1. Copy the ``genesis.sh`` script to the genesis node and run it as sudo. In the
   event of runtime errors, refer to :doc:`troubleshooting/genesis`
2. Validate the genesis node by running ``validate-genesis.sh`` on it.
3. Nodes for which ``join-<NODE>.sh`` scripts have been generated should be
   provisioned at this point, and need to have network connectivity to the
   genesis node. (This could be a manual Ubuntu provision, or a Drydock-
   initiated PXE boot in the case of a full fledged Airship deployment).
4. Join master nodes by copying their respective ``join-<NODE>.sh`` scripts to
   them and running them.
5. Validate the master nodes by copying and running their respective
   ``validate-<NODE>.sh`` scripts on each of them.
6. Re-provision the Genesis node

   a) Run the ``/usr/local/bin/promenade-teardown`` script on the Genesis node:
   b) Delete the node from the cluster via one of the other nodes ``kubectl delete node <GENESIS>``.
   c) Power off and re-image the Genesis node.
   d) Join the genesis node as a normal node using its ``join-<GENESIS>.sh`` script.
   e) Validate the node using ``validate-<GENSIS>.sh``.

7. Join and validate all remaining nodes using the ``join-<NODE>.sh`` and
   ``validate-<NODE>.sh`` scripts described above.


API-Driven Deployment
---------------------

This approach leverages the Promenade API to fetch join scripts as needed.
This is the approach used in the functional testing discussed below.

Setup
^^^^^

Follow the setup instructions above for `Basic Deployment`_.  Then, start a webserver to serve
configuration to Promenade.

.. code-block:: bash

    cat build/*.yaml > promenade.yaml
    mv promenade.yaml build/promenade.yaml
    docker rm -fv promenade-nginx
    docker run -d \
        -p 7777:80 \
        --restart=always \
        --name promenade-nginx \
        -v build:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
            nginx:stable
    export DESIGN_REF=http://192.168.77.1:7777/promenade.yaml

Execution
^^^^^^^^^

Perform the following steps to execute the deployment:

1. Copy the ``genesis.sh`` script to the genesis node and run it.
2. Validate the genesis node by running ``validate-genesis.sh`` on it.
3. Generate join script for a node using:


.. code-block:: bash

    URL=http://promenade-api.ucp.svc.cluster.local/api/v1.0/join-scripts?
    URL="${URL}design_ref=${DESIGN_REF}"
    URL="${URL}&hostname=<HOSTNAME>&ip=<IP>"
    URL="${URL}&labels.dynamic=calico-etcd=enabled"
    URL="${URL}&labels.dynamic=kubernetes-apiserver=enabled"
    URL="${URL}&labels.dynamic=kubernetes-controller-manager=enabled"
    URL="${URL}&labels.dynamic=kubernetes-etcd=enabled"
    URL="${URL}&labels.dynamic=kubernetes-scheduler=enabled"
    URL="${URL}&labels.dynamic=ucp-control-plane=enabled"
    curl -Lo join-<NODE>.sh "${URL}"

4. Copy the join script to the node, and run it via ``bash join-<NODE>.sh``.
5. Repeat 3 and 4 until all nodes are joined.
6. Reprovision the Genesis node by tearing it down as above in
   `Basic Deployment`_, then generating and using a join script for it as done
   in 3 and 4.


Running Tests
-------------

Initial Setup of Virsh Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To setup a local functional testing environment on your Ubuntu 16.04 machine,
run:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/setup_gate.sh

Running Functional Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run complete functional tests locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/gate.sh

For more verbose output, try:

.. code-block:: bash

    PROMENADE_DEBUG=1 ./tools/gate.sh

For extremely verbose output, try:

.. code-block:: bash

    GATE_DEBUG=1 PROMENADE_DEBUG=1 ./tools/gate.sh

The gate leaves its test VMs running for convenience.  To shut everything down:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/stop_gate.sh

To run a particular set of functional tests, you can specify the set on the
command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/gate.sh <SUITE>

Valid functional test suites are defined by JSON files that live in
``tools/g2/manifests``.

Utilities
^^^^^^^^^

There are a couple of helper utilities available for interacting with gate VMs.
These can be found in ``tools/g2/bin``.  The most important is certainly
``ssh.sh``, which allows you to connect easily to test VMs:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/g2/bin/ssh.sh n0


Development
-----------

Using a Local Registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Repeatedly downloading multiple copies images during development can be quite
slow.  To avoid this issue, you can run a docker registry on the development
host:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/registry/start.sh
    ./tools/registry/update_cache.sh

Then, the images used by the basic example can be updated using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/registry/update_example.sh

That change can be undone via:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/registry/revert_example.sh

The registry can be stopped with:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/registry/stop.sh


Building the image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build the image directly, you can use the standard Docker build command:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker build -t promenade:local .

To build the image from behind a proxy, you can:

.. code-block:: bash

    export http_proxy=...
    export no_proxy=...
    docker build --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg https_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg no_proxy=$no_proxy -t promenade:local .


For convenience, there is a script which builds an image from the current code,
then uses it to generate certificates and construct scripts:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/dev-build.sh examples/basic build


Using Promenade Behind a Proxy
------------------------------

To use Promenade from behind a proxy, use the proxy settings see
:doc:`configuration/kubernetes-network`.
